üò∞ Stressed about sample size in your Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Model?
Planning a PLS-SEM, but unsure how many participants you need?
Worried that your expected effect size is small and your sample might be...even smaller?
Still relying on vague heuristics like the ‚Äú10-times rule‚Äù?
We‚Äôve all been there. Well, not exactly "all", to be fair...

Say hello to `plssempower`, an R package designed to make power analysis for PLS-SEM models fast, transparent, and reproducible.
Using the inverse square root method introduced by Kock & Hadaya (2018), this package lets you:

- Compute the required sample size for a given effect size (_a priori_)
- Compute the Minimum Detectable Effect Size (MDES) for a given sample (_sensitivity_)

Visualise your results with clear, (slightly) customizable graphs
All in one function. No more guessing. No more excuses.


# PLS-SEM-power

An R package for computing power and sensitivity analyses in Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) using the inverse square root method.

## üöÄ What does this package do?

This package provides two simple functions:

- `pls_sem_power()` ‚Äì Computes either the **minimum sample size** needed for a given Minimum Detectable Effect Size (MDES), or the **MDES** for a given sample size, based on the formula proposed by Kock & Hadaya (2018).
- `pls_sem_power_graph()` ‚Äì Generates ggplot2 graphs showing the relationship between MDES and sample size, including reference lines for the user‚Äôs input.

## üìä Methodology

The package is based on the **inverse square root method**, introduced by Kock & Hadaya (2018), which is a practical approach for determining sample sizes in PLS-SEM. The key formula used is:
N = (pŒ± / pmin)^2


Where:
- `pŒ±` is a constant depending on the significance level (Œ± = 0.01, 0.05, 0.10),
- `pmin` is the path coefficient with minimum magnitude expected to be significant.

## üîß Usage

```r
# Compute the required sample size for a given MDES
pls_sem_power(method = "a priori", MDES = 0.2, alpha = 0.05)

# Compute MDES for a given sample size
pls_sem_power(method = "sensitivity", N = 63, alpha = 0.05)

# Generate graph (a priori)
pls_sem_power_graph(method = "a priori", MDES = 0.2, alpha = 0.05)

# Generate graph (sensitivity)
pls_sem_power_graph(method = "sensitivity", N = 63, alpha = 0.05)
```
_Notes_:
- The alpha argument accepts only three values: 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10.
- When using `pls_sem_power_graph`, you can set `theme = "min"` to apply a minimal white background, which may improve readability in certain contexts.
